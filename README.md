# INF-2D, Reasoning and Agents, Coursework 1, Part IV: Extensions (20 pts)

I took on the last proposition and made platform to play Quoridor online, it authenticates users with Github and there is a hub where users can create their games or join an already created one, once a game is full it diassapers from the hub but it is still visible for spectators if they know the URL.

Once playing the game I made it have the same aesthetic as if we where playing on a terminal, maybe a bit prettier and with less scrolls. Once the games are finish or left, they are deleted from the database.

I built everything using React JS, Firebase and Material-UI.
